A guest spot on his television call-in show provided current and aspiring candidates a way to reach a national audience in a low-stress, friendly environment.</p><p>Donald Trump, back when he was just a larger-then-life real-estate developer and New York socialite, was a regular on King's programme. It's not entirely surprising then that the Republican nominee accepted an interview request from his long-time friend.</p><p>That, however, is when Mr Trump's staff should have done a bit of research, found out the interview would be broadcast on RT and told their candidate to come up with a scheduling conflict and politely pull out. Given the heat Mr Trump has taken recently for showering praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian-owned RT is the last outlet he should be on.</p><p>This is either another example of the Trump team's questionable advance work or - perhaps more troubling - its judgement. No matter the explanation, the story re-enforces <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/10/this-summer-nobody-seems-to-like-russia-except-donald-trump/" class="story-body__link-external">the politically damaging perception</a> that Mr Trump is uncomfortably chummy with the Russian government.</p><hr class="story-body__line"/><p>Private cyber-security analysts have blamed Russian intelligence agencies for electronic break-ins into Democratic Party computers that emerged in leaks over the summer.</p><p>Earlier this week Defence Secretary Ash Carter said the US would not ignore Russia's "efforts to interfere with our democratic processes".</p><figure class="media-with-caption"><p class="media-player-wrapper">
